## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1
1. **RwLock >< Mutex**  
RwLock is used because the notification list is frequently read and only occasionally written, allowing multiple readers to access it concurrently. Mutex would block all access even for reads. Therefore, RwLock provides better concurrency for read-heavy workloads.
2. **Rust static >< Java static (lazy_static)**  
Rust does not allow mutable static variables by default because it cannot guarantee thread safety at compile time. This differs from Java, where static variables can be freely mutated but may lead to runtime issues. Therefore, lazy_static is used with synchronization primitives to safely initialize and mutate shared data.

#### Reflection Subscriber-2
1. **Q1**  
I checked files outside the tutorial scope such as src/lib.rs to understand how environment variables and configuration are loaded. I learned that these components simplify dependency sharing across modules. However, I did not modify them to keep consistency with the tutorial hehe :)
2. **Q2**   
The Observer pattern decouples publisher and subscribers, so adding more receivers is straightforward by simply registering them. In contrast, spawning multiple Main apps would require synchronization or shared storage.
3. **Q3**  
I did not create additional tests. However, I tested multiple scenarios by running several Receiver instances, which helped me verify that the notification system works correctly for multiple subscribers.
